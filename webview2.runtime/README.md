GitHub does not allow pushing large binaries to the repository.
So ideally to install WebView2 component, you must install Evergreen Runtime or either Fixed Runtime.
You can download WebView2 distributed runtime from: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/

# Deploy with Fixed Runtime
Extract your fixed runtime to platform specific folder:
  - For x64, extract x64 package to x64 folder
  - For x86, extract x86 package to x86 folder
